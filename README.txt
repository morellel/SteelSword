BlondeNightmare's Steel Sword Mod v1.0
Minecraft version 1.12.2
--------------------------
This is the first version of the Steel Sword Mod.
Currently, the mod adds an item called the "Steel Sword", a new sword combat item.
This sword item has a regular sword weight and a 7.5 attack damage rating, slightly better than a diamond sword.

There are currently no recipes for the sword, and no way to obtain it other than going into creative mode in the "combat" section.

Future Update Goals
--------------------
-Sword will weigh less than regular swords, reflecting the lightweight nature of carbon in steel.
-Sword will have the same attack damage rating as iron.
-The next update will be on minecraft version 1.15.2.
